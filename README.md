# PWM-generator-using-verilog
This project is made using verilog on Xilinx. This will help in changing the pulse width of the output wave by using two signals that are increase duty cycle &amp; decrease duty cycle. 

Just unzip the PWMgenerator folder & open PWMgenerator.xise in xilinx software.
Then run the test bench.
